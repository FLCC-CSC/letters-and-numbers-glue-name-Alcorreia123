'''

1. What is a lesson you learned during this lab? You do not have to restrict
   your response to Python. It might be a lesson in time management, a lesson
   using CodeGrade, or something else.

   In this lab, I really learned how to fail over and over again
   until I got it just right. I had to deal with feelings of discouragment,
   as well as excitement when I finally figured it all out!
